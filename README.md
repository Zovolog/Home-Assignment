Task wich works with API.
How to run?
---For running my solution you need just to open index.html.

Some other information
---There is a bug at my program which is connected with CORS. For avoiding this issue. 
I recommend to run not more than 15 requests or use browser pluggin.
--- For Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf
--- For Firefox https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/access-control-allow-origin/


Choosing servers.
--- If you choose non-proxy, you can make only 15 requests for one time.
--- If you choose proxy server, you should press the button on that site https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo, then you don`t have issues with CORS, BUT you can make only 50 requests for 1 hour.
